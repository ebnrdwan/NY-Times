**MVVM Best Pratice:**
- Avoid references to Views in ViewModels.
- Instead of pushing data to the UI, let the UI observe changes to it.
- Distribute responsibilities, add a domain layer if needed.
- Add a data repository as the single-point entry to your data.
- Expose information about the state of your data using a wrapper or another LiveData.
- Consider edge cases, leaks and how long-running operations can affect the instances in your architecture.
- Don‚Äôt put logic in the ViewModel that is critical to saving clean state or related to data. Any call you make from a ViewModel can be the last one.

## Goal
ShowCase for the trended architecture and tools used in android in a simple sample
# \[ üöß Work in progress ‚õèüë∑üîß üöß \]

### Non-Goals
make a production ready-code, this is playground

## Doing
- Adding more ui testing and validate the fleaky ones
- Adding integration test
- Apply custom lint rules
- Revisit architecture and  testing and for upcoming enhancements



## Todo
**apply static code analysis: apply one or more**
- detekt
- findBug
- SonarQube

**using CI/CD: apply one or more**
- Gitlab with integration with slack
- Travis




## Contribution
Very welcome.

## Code Coverage

coverage reports can be generated by executing the following command in terminal `gradlew createDebugCoverageReport`
it will be generated at `app\build\reports\coverage\debug\index.html`




## Run Custom Lint Rules
in build.gradle (project level) there are two gradle tasks
- **checkDevelopmentDebugQuality** for full lint build
- **checkDevelopmentDebugQualityClear** for lint build without java compilation
 use this if you are compiling with a JDK less than  1.9
- **view results in html/mxl files** inside build/reports
